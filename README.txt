Bring your Soma Shade and Tilt devices, connected via the Soma Connect hub, into Homey.

Open the blinds when your alarm goes off to Wake up to sunshine.
Close the blinds in the evening so it looks like you are at home all the time.
Room getting too hot then close the blinds to keep the sun out.
Homey can do it all when you integrate all your devices.
